                                    # Main Part #
################################################################################

## Prerequisites necessary to use this code

# (1) Create an AlphaVantage account for free at  https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key and request an API
#
# (2) Construct a spreadsheet (.csv) with  all sales/purchase information in it:
#
# The structure of the spreadsheet should be like this:
#
# Date       | Quantity_Stock1 | Price_Stock1    | Payments_Stock1| Cost_Stock1 |
# 20xx-xx-xx |      Float      |      Float      |      Float     |      Float  |
#
# "Stock1" should be the string-handle used to pull the security-series from AlphaVantage.
# E.g. if you want to pull Apple's stock price, use "Quantity_AAPL", "Price_AAPL", etc
#
# For symbol search define SEARCHWORD and find ticker:
# https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=SYMBOL_SEARCH&keywords=SEARCHWORD&apikey=6M3D8EV1HA6WKQFI
#
# Adding new infomation just requires adding  additional rows. Adding a new security
# means adding four new columns

## Procedures

# Set start/end date of of data sample:

start_date          = "2019-01-04";  # Trading information available starts on "2018-04-03".
end_date            = [];  # if "end_date" is empty, the last available value will be set.


# (1) Load Trading Information avialable: - Which titles and in which quantity have been traded on this account over the entire horizon?

raw_trades, trading_start, header_types, full_name_list = get_trading_info(wdir);

# (2) Use available trading information and match it to desired sample horizon.
#     Only load security data of securities traded in respective interval.
#
#     This requires the following steps:

# (2a) - Which titles and which quantity did I trade within selected start/end_date (today)?
#      - Find securities in "full_name_list" that are not in trading sample within selected time span.
#      - Create a subset that only pulls, analyzes and prints securities available in in
#        the selected time span.
# (2b) - Determine initial/already exisiting positions of a security for any date
#        starting after 'trading_start'. Neded for accounting/valuation purposes later.

    # Date to start portfolio analysis: should not set to values before 'trading_start'
